Every step you take
Every smile you make
Every bond you break
Every shame you shake
I will joy in you

Every single day
Every time you pray
Every truth you say
Every note you play
I will joy in you

How I long to see
you climb strong and free!
How my glad heart aches
with every step you take.

Every love you wake
Every hill you take
Every fear you break
Every friend you make
I will joy in you

Since you've grown I've been cheering for your grace
I dream at night and I warm when I see your face
I look around but it's you I can't replace
I feel so proud and I long for your embrace
I keep praying you'll become all you can be

How I long to see
you climb strong and free!
How my glad heart aches
with every step you take.

Every hope you wake
Every height you make
Every doubt you break
Every care you shake
I will joy in you

Every part you take
Every dream you wake
I will joy in you
I will joy in you

Every prize you take
Every push you make
Every chain you break
Every pain you shake

I will joy in you

Every single day
Every time you pray
Every thanks you say
Every goal you weigh

I will joy in you

Every turn you take
Every most you make
Every frown you break
Every load you shake

I will joy in you

Every single day
Every truth you pray
Every peace you say
Every good you weigh

I will joy in you

Every bow you take
Every hope you make
Every blame you break
Every grief you shake

I will joy in you

Every single way
Every love you say
Every time you pray
Every dawning day

I will joy in you.

Every breath you take
Every move you make
Every bond you break
Every step you take
I'll be watching you

Every single day
Every word you say
Every game you play
Every night you stay
I'll be watching you

Oh can't you see
You belong to me
My poor heart aches
With every step you take

Every move you make
Every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake
I'll be watching you

Since you've gone I been lost without a trace
I dream at night I can only see your face
I look around but it's you I can't replace
I feel so cold and I long for your embrace
I keep crying baby, baby, please

Oh can't you see
You belong to me
My poor heart aches
With every step you take

Every move you make
Every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake
I'll be watching you

Every move you make
Every step you take
I'll be watching you
I'll be watching you

  (Every breath you take, 
  every move you make,
  every bond you break,
  every step you take)

I'll be watching you

  (Every single day,
  every word you say,
  every game you play,
  every night you stay)

I'll be watching you

  (Every move you make,
  every vow you break,
  every smile you fake,
  every claim you stake)

I'll be watching you

  (Every single day,
  every word you say,
  every game you play,
  every night you stay)

I'll be watching you

  (Every breath you take,
  every move you make,
  every bond you break,
  every step you take)

I'll be watching you

  (Every single day,
  every word you say,
  every game you play,
  every night you stay)

I'll be watching you
