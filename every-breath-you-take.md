## Goal
Original song was about a jealous, stalking ex-boyfriend. New song should be about a parent who rejoices in his child spreading their wings and learning from life.

## Lyrics
```
Every breath you take
  Every step you take
Every move you make
  Every smile you make
Every bond you break
  Every bond you break
Every step you take
  Every low you shake
I'll be watching you
  I will joy in you

Every single day
  Every single day
Every word you say
  Every time you pray
Every game you play
  Every truth you say
Every night you stay
  Every vow you weigh
I'll be watching you
  I will joy in you

Oh can't you see
  How I long to see
You belong to me
  You stand strong and free 
My poor heart aches
  How my glad heart aches 
With every step you take
  With every step you take
  
Every move you make
  Every love you wake 
Every vow you break
  Every hill you take
Every smile you fake
  Every dawn that breaks
Every claim you stake
  Every friend you make
I'll be watching you
  I will joy in you

Since you've gone I been lost without a trace
  Since you've grown I been cheering for your grace
I dream at night I can only see your face
  I dream at night and I warm when I see your face
I look around but it's you I can't replace
  I think of you and 
I feel so cold and I long for your embrace
  I feel so 
I keep crying baby, baby, please
Oh can't you see
You belong to me
My poor heart aches
With every step you take
Every move you make
Every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake
I'll be watching you
Every move you make
Every step you take
I'll be watching you
I'll be watching you
(Every breath you take, every move you make, every bond you break, every step you take)
I'll be watching you
(Every single day, every word you say, every game you play, every night you stay)
I'll be watching you
(Every move you make, every vow you break, every smile you fake, every claim you stake)
I'll be watching you
(Every single day, every word you say, every game you play, every night you stay)
I'll be watching you
(Every breath you take, every move you make, every bond you break, every step you take)
I'll be watching you
(Every single day, every word you say, every game you play, every night you stay)
I'll be watching you
